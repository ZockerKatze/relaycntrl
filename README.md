# relaycntrl


this is a very shitty programm for raspberry pi to controll a relay board (there are 8 relays on the card)
idk why i made this, i definetly lost braincells

IF U WANT NEW V7 VERSION, I want it too, i am to lazy to release maybe in future you can see in my repo!

  F**K YOU IT HAPPEND I WONT UPDATE THE V7 


DOWNLOAD THE BIGGEST V_ NUMBER!!!!! IT WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER THAN THE LAST ONE!!!!!

the pins are [2, 3, 26, 17, 27, 22, 10, 9] --> i changed 4 cause i want 2 do fm_transmitter too

if your wondering why my name in the programm is rattatwingo, well i forgot my github password and cant bother to change it so yea
